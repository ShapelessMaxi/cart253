/**
Love, actually
Maxime Perreault

We're often looking for love anywhere we can find it... because we feel like we need it!
The problem is that the amount of compatible matches are limited. I know, there's plenty
of fish in the sea... but let's be realistic here. In this simulation, I want to explore
the idea that not every 'love interest' is a good one. I also want to add the idea that
there isn't just one perfect match.

As the player, you control a circle that starts grey. There's another circle at the start,
it's your first love interest. Every time yo click the left-mouse button, you change color randomly.
Every time you click, another randomly colored circle appears, but the other circles shrink in size.
There will be a maximum nuber of circles on the screen, the smaller circles get eliminated.
You have to find the color to match the another circle.

Easter egg: if there is more than one matching circle, you can go around and love them all!
