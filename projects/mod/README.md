## _mod()_

_an experimental game by maxi_

Hey! My name is Maxime Perreault, and I’m a queer artist living and working in Tiohtiá:ke (Montreal). I use a few different digital media when I create, and I also tattoo. I’ve always been curious about body modifications, and I dove into the tattoo and piercing world as soon as I was of age to do so. As a queer person that thinks a lot about identity and the relationship I have with my physical self, I recently started exploring what having a body meant. I think it’s something a lot of marginalized people can relate to, as we are most likely to be judged and set apart from others based on our physical appearance, making us hyper aware of our personal visual image.

Growing up, I’ve been subject to a lot of microaggression, and rarely felt pretty and confident. Taking agency over how my body looks like made me realize two things. First, I want to look different and I can be different. Second, it's possible to achieve that and have confidence in who I am and how I present myself. Having others tattoo and pierce my body, putting trust in them, and most importantly choosing how I wanted to look was a breakthrough in my self-love journey. It felt liberating and powerful at first, and it still feels the same now.

This idea of body modification as a way to feel in control is the overall message I wanted to convey with mod(), an interactive and generative experimental game. When you start the game, you are welcomed with a narrative, pulling you right into the subject. I’m hoping it will make the players think about their body, how they use it and what kind of relationship they have with it. I want them to think about how much their physical appearance affects their life.

You then arrive in a menu screen, assertively asking you to enter a name, and giving you the info, it will be useful and important in the future. The slightly aggressive tone of this menu contrast greatly with the intro narrative and the next ‘main game’ screen. It also makes you ponder what will happen next and keeps the experience interesting for the user.

Finally, when you arrive in the main game screen, a mysterious, semi-futuristic and space-y atmosphere receives you. There’s a user interface with unfinished instructions, and there’s only one way to discover their use: press the keys. The keys modify the body in weird and unpredictable fashions, and in addition to that, provoke some minor sound and visual effects. There's no ending to this, you can modify forever, and even try to get back to your original shape

Overall, I wanted the mood of this game to be dark, mysterious, and unpredictable. I think modifying your body in real life induce similar feelings, as you never fully know what will happen and how you will react. It’s exciting and mildly scary… Are you ready to leap into it?

>
> - fix the 'shoot' algorithm
> - make the visual language more coherent with the concept
> - add more algorithms
> - make the current algorithms more visually intense and unpredictable
> - have a few more 'starting' body shapes
