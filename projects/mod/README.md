## _mod()_

_an experimental game by maxi_

Hey! My name is Maxime Perreault, and I’m a queer artist living and working in Tiohtiá:ke (Montreal). I use a few different digital media when I create, and I also tattoo.

I’ve always been curious about body modifications, and I dove into the tattoo and piercing world as soon as I was of age to do so. As a queer person that thinks a lot about identity and the relationship I have with my physical self, I recently started exploring what having a body meant. I think it’s something a lot of marginalized people can relate to, as we are most likely to be judged and set apart from others based on our physical appearance, making us hyper aware of our personal visual image.

Growing up, I’ve been subject to a lot of microaggression, and rarely felt pretty and confident. Taking agency over how my body looks like really made me realize two things. I not only wanted to look different, but I could also be different while having enough assurance in who I was to not care about other’s perception of myself.

Having people tattoo and pierce my body, putting trust in them, and most importantly choosing how I wanted to look was a breakthrough in my self-confidence journey. It felt liberating and powerful at first, and it still feels the same now. That is the overall message I wanted to convey with mod(), an interactive and generative experimental game.

When you start the game, you are welcomed with this narrative, pulling you into the story. I’m hoping it will make the players think about their body, how they use it and what kind of relationship they have with it.

You then arrive in a menu screen, assertively asking you to enter a name, and giving you the info, it will be useful and important in the future. The slightly aggressive tone of this menu contrast greatly with the intro narrative and the next ‘main game’ screen. It also makes you ponder what will happen next and keeps the experience interesting for the user.

Finally, when you arrive in the main game screen, a mysterious, semi-futuristic and space-y atmosphere receives you. There’s a user interface with unfinished instructions, and there’s only one way to discover their use: press the keys. The keys modify the body in weird and unpredictable fashions, and in addition to that, provoke some minor sound and visual effects.

Overall, I wanted the mood of this game to be dark, mysterious, and unpredictable. I think modifying your body in real life induce similar feelings, as you never fully know what will happen and how you will react. It’s exciting and mildly scary… Are you ready to leap into it?
