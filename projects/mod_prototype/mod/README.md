mod()
an interactive and generative sandbox game
created by Maxime Perreault

this is the project 2 prototype (name is a placeholder).

probably a narrative sandbox game that makes you think about what it means to
have a body, to have authority over it, and to modify it.
to learn more about the program plan, the concept, the story and everything
in-between, see the proposal's pdf.
(eventually, add real description)
